# Maintenance_v2
Written By Barry McNickle
Still under development

This program aids the user to keep track of regular maintenance of their vehicle(s).<br>
It is intended to work on both Android and Apple devices in the future, although has so far only been tested on or aimed at Andriod.<br>
The user will have a garage where they can add or remove vehicles.  It will also have a section where the user can update the milage of a vehicle after they have been driving it.  The user will then be able to tell the program that they have performed a maintenance job on the vehicle, assigning a repeat value in miles or time (or both).  Each time the user opens the program it will look at this information and warn them if work needs to be done in the next few weeks or miles.<br>
<br>
The program is still in the early stages of development. The areas still to be worked on are:<br>
--Validation for entry of new vehicle (no repeated licence plates - no blank data).<br>
--Correct display format of the garage (data being read from file - just not displayed the way I want).<br>
--Update_Milage function (should be straight forward once the garage is completed).<br>
--Maintenance function
